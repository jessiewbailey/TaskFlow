# SSE Connection Test Results

## Test Setup Completed ✅

### 1. Frontend Infrastructure
- Created `EventStreamService.ts` with browser-compatible EventEmitter
- Created `useRequestEvents.ts` hook for React components
- Created `useRequestProgress.ts` hook for progress tracking
- Created `SSETestComponent.jsx` for testing

### 2. Configuration
- Updated Vite config to proxy `/api` requests to `http://localhost:8008`
- Fixed EventEmitter import issue for browser compatibility

### 3. Deployment
- Built and pushed new frontend image with SSE test component
- Restarted web deployment successfully

## Current Status

The SSE infrastructure is now in place and ready for testing. The test component has been temporarily added to the Dashboard and will display:

- Connection status
- Real-time progress updates
- Progress bar visualization
- Event log with timestamps
- Workflow step tracking (for workflow jobs)

## How to Test

1. **Access the Dashboard**: Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. **Select a Task**: Click on any task in the table
3. **View SSE Test Component**: It appears below the filters panel
4. **Create New Task**: To see real-time updates, create a new task and watch the embedding progress

## API Verification

Latest request (ID: 37) shows:
- `embedding_status`: "COMPLETED" ✅

This confirms that the backend is processing embeddings correctly.

## Next Steps

1. Open browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Select a task to see the SSE test component
3. Monitor browser console for SSE connection logs
4. Create a new task to see real-time embedding progress
5. Check Network tab in DevTools for EventStream connection

## Architecture Summary

```
Browser → Vite Dev Server → Proxy → Backend API (8008)
                                         ↓
                                    SSE Endpoint
                                         ↑
                                    Redis Pub/Sub
                                         ↑
                                    AI Worker Events
```

The complete event flow is now implemented from AI worker through Redis to SSE to browser.
