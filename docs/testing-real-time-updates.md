# Testing Real-Time Updates

## Access the Application

1. **Open TaskFlow Dashboard**: http://localhost:3000
2. **View Components Test Pages**:
   - Progress Bar Test: http://localhost:3000/test/progress-bar
   - Request Card Test: http://localhost:3000/test/request-card

## What to Look For

### In the Main Dashboard (http://localhost:3000)

1. **View Toggle**: In the top-right of the requests section, you'll see toggle buttons:
   - üìä Table view (default)
   - üî≤ Card view (shows RequestCard components)

2. **Real-Time Updates**:
   - Look for request #38 from "Real-Time Test User"
   - If it's still processing, you'll see:
     - A progress bar showing percentage completion
     - "Processing..." status
     - Live indicator (red dot with "LIVE" text)
   - Embedding status icons:
     - ‚è≥ = Pending
     - üîÑ = Processing (animated)
     - ‚úÖ = Completed
     - ‚ùå = Failed

3. **No Refresh Needed**:
   - The UI updates automatically
   - Progress bars animate smoothly
   - Status changes happen in real-time

## Creating New Test Requests

To see the real-time updates in action, create a new request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8008/api/requests \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "text": "Test request to demonstrate real-time progress updates. Please analyze this text and show me how the progress bar works.",
    "requester": "Demo User",
    "exercise_id": 1
  }'
```

Then watch the dashboard - no refresh needed!

## Features to Test

1. **Progress Bar Animation**:
   - Smooth progression from 0% to 100%
   - Color changes based on status
   - Time estimates (elapsed and remaining)

2. **Card View**:
   - Toggle to card view to see RequestCard components
   - Each card shows embedding status
   - Live indicator appears during processing

3. **SSE Connection**:
   - Open browser DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
   - Look for "events" connections (EventStream type)
   - These are the SSE connections providing real-time updates

## Troubleshooting

- **No updates appearing?** Check browser console for SSE connection errors
- **Progress stuck?** Check if AI worker is running: `kubectl get pods -n taskflow`
- **Can't see card view?** Make sure you're using the toggle buttons in the requests section

## Architecture Verification

The real-time flow works as follows:
1. Create request ‚Üí Backend queues embedding job
2. AI Worker processes ‚Üí Publishes events to Redis
3. API subscribes to Redis ‚Üí Sends SSE events to browser
4. React components update ‚Üí UI refreshes automatically

You should see all of this happen without any manual page refreshes!
