# Live Updates Implementation

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Card View
- Removed the toggle between table and card view per your request
- Dashboard now uses only the table view

### 2. Removed Embedding Column
- No longer showing embedding status as a separate column
- Embedding processing is now part of the overall processing status

### 3. Implemented Live Updates with Polling
Since SSE wasn't connecting properly through the nginx proxy, I implemented a polling-based solution:

- **RequestsTableLive.tsx**: New table component with live updates
- **ProcessingStatus component**: Polls the API every second for active jobs
- **Automatic refresh**: When a job completes, the table refreshes automatically

## How It Works

1. **Active Job Detection**: If a request has `has_active_jobs = true`, the ProcessingStatus component starts polling
2. **Progress Display**: Shows "Processing..." text (progress bar ready when job progress endpoint is available)
3. **Auto-refresh**: When polling detects job completion, it triggers a table refresh
4. **No Manual Refresh**: Updates happen automatically without user intervention

## Current Status Display

- **Pending**: Gray "Pending" text
- **Processing**: Blue "Processing..." text (will show progress bar when API provides progress data)
- **Completed**: Green "v[version] completed" text
- **Failed**: Red "Failed" text with error tooltip

## Testing

You can test by:
1. Creating a new request at http://localhost:3000
2. Watching the Processing Status column - it will show "Processing..." for active jobs
3. The status will automatically update to "completed" when done
4. No page refresh required!

## Future Enhancements

1. **Job Queue Position**: Once the API provides queue position, we can show "3 jobs ahead" etc.
2. **Progress Bar**: When the job progress endpoint is available, we'll show actual progress
3. **SSE Integration**: Can be re-enabled once nginx proxy configuration is fixed

## Technical Details

- Polling interval: 1 second for active jobs
- Only polls requests with `has_active_jobs = true`
- Stops polling once job completes
- Minimal performance impact as it only polls visible requests
